# Crosswords, but ZORK.

This repo offers a text-based adventure where you can solve a crossword puzzle. Why not?

If you're unsure about the puzzle-specific ZORK syntax, try the commands "HELP" or "MAN". They will show you the available commands.

Note that this is a WIP, so not every command does something helpful.
